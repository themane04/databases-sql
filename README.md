# Databases

This project signifies my first venture into designing a city library system, which introduced me to the concepts of Entity-Relationship Models (ERM) and Diagrams (ERD) for the first time.

### The ERD for the city library
Below is the ERD I devised for the database. Although it may contain imperfections, it stands as a significant milestone in my learning journey.

### The ERM for the city library
Additionally, here is the ERM I developed for the same database. Like the ERD, this diagram has areas for improvement, but it reflects my evolving understanding of database design.

Following my initial foray into the world of Entity-Relationship Models (ERM) and Diagrams (ERD), I embarked on a more comprehensive exercise: designing and implementing a database for a New Year's market. This task extended beyond conceptualization, requiring me to bring the database to life using PgAdmin (PostgreSQL), thereby converting theory into practice.

### The ERM for the New Year's market
The journey through database normalization is captured in the screenshot below, illustrating the meticulous progression through the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Normal Forms (NF), and culminating with the Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) for the New 
Year's market project:

To facilitate efficient data management within this newly created database, I developed a Python script, 'script.py', which is available in this repository. This script represents the synergy between database management and programming, demonstrating how automation can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of populating database tables. By automating data entry into each table, script.py exemplifies a practical application of programming to optimize database operations, highlighting the project's success in integrating technical knowledge with practical execution.
